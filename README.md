# Examples

This repository includes examples for some common tasks and integrations that you may want to build into an app when using Expo tools.

Each directory includes an example and the README in the directory explains how to use it and the idea behind the example.

## Contributing

Have an example you'd like to add? Follow the README template in the existing examples and open up a pull request, we'd be happy to consider it! Keep in mind that each example needs to be updated regularly along with new SDK releases, so there is some maintenance burden associated. The example should be for a common enough usage scenario that can't be better explained through a documentation paged.
