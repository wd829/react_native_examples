# Expo Examples

This repo contains a whole bunch of examples to be able to see Expo in action! There are folders of complete projects
for you to take a look at, as well as a couple of [Snacks](https://expo.io/tools#snack) that make it quick and easy to see our
[APIs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/sdk/overview/) at work.
