It's common to need to perform a set of tasks once you publish an update to your project. For example, you may want to notify people on Twitter or Slack, upload sourcemaps and cut a release on Sentry, etc. This example demonstrates how you can write your own simple hooks with `./hooks/echo.js`, and install and use hooks distributed through npm, such as `expo-prepublish-slack-notify`.

## ðŸš€ How to use

#### Configure it

- Create an incoming webhook for your Slack server and replace `https://hooks.slack.com/put-your-stuff-here` in `app.config.js` with your webhook url -- or remove the `expo-postpublish-slack-notify` hook entirely from `app.config.js`.

#### Running the app

- Run `yarn` or `npm install`
- Run [`expo start`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/), try it out.
