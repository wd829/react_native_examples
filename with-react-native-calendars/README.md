## The idea behind the example

[react-native-calendars](https://github.com/wix/react-native-calendars)
is a well-built and popular library from Wix engineering for displaying
and interacting with calendars in various forms. This example is based
out on the example project from the react-native-calendars repo, but
it uses react-navigation here.
