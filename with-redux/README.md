# Redux example

## How to use

### Running the app

- `cd` into the `app` directory and run `yarn` or `npm install`
- Open `app` with `exp` or XDE, try it out.

## The idea behind the example

If you wanted to see an example of redux, react animated, and an API call all in one file. This is the example for you.
