# SQLite Example

Example demonstrating use of the `SQLite` API in Expo.

The app allows adding todo items, marking them as done, and deleting done items.
`SQLite` features used include creating and opening databases, creating tables,
inserting items, querying and displaying results, using prepared statements.
