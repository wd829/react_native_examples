# victory-native

Try it at https://expo.io/@community/victory-native-example

## How to use

## Running the app

- Run `yarn` or `npm install`
- Run [`expo start`](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/), try it out.

## The idea behind the example

Expo includes react-native-svg, which is the only native dependency for
victory-native. This demo shows that it's as simple as adding a
supported version of victory-native and then using it as suggested in
the docs. The code in main.js is copied directly out of the
victory-native example app.
